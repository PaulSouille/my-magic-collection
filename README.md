Todo fast :
search bar for cards
display stock and price on card hover ( and blur background)
rarity/inStock filter ( rarity based on icon lib)
load more button (automatic on max scroll ?)
add/remove to collection button
disable card if not in stock

Todo less fast :
add full art
Display X/300 under extension images
add cardgame redirect button
set different background color on dark mode because of black card's border
add searchbar title in database for each extensions ( LTR = sauron, saruman, gandalf...)
Todo slow fast:
scan feature

Todo maybe one day :
a good design...
